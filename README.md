## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is julian. I love developing high performance applications & teach people on how to do that on their own.

I am part of the [`Push Based`](https://push-based.io/) team, where I am running workshops & trainings, do consulting and help our customers to improve the performance of their applications.

### RxAngular

I am core maintainer of the [`RxAngular`](https://github.com/rx-angular/rx-angular) project.

RxAngular offers a comprehensive toolkit for handling fully reactive Angular applications with the main focus on runtime performance, template rendering, and Developer eXperience.

RxAngular is made up of different packages that work together or standalone.

#### @rx-angular/state

A powerful state management library, providing a fully reactive way to manage state in components and services.

#### @rx-angular/template

A set of directives and pipes designed for high-performance and non-blocking rendering for large-scale applications.

The template package especially stands out in terms of runtime performance. Its unique feature is the "concurrent mode", which is a port of reacts concurrent mode into the angular world.

#### @rx-angular/cdk

A Component Development Kit for high-performance and ergonomic Angular UI libs and large-scale applications.

#### @rx-angular/isr

A library that enables Angular Universal applications to generate static pages at runtime and then update them incrementally on demand or on a schedule.
